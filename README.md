# SpokeToWork Planning

Planning repository for SpokeToWork - a bicycle-based job hunting app for Cleveland, Tennessee.

## [View Wireframes](https://tortoisewolfe.github.io/SpokeToWork-MVP/design/wireframes/)

Interactive UI designs for all SpokeToWork features - 17 screens covering company tracking, route planning, employer features, and more.

## What This Repo Is

This is a **planning repository**, not the actual codebase. It contains:
- Product constitution and requirements
- Feature specifications (via SpecKit)
- Research materials (Cleveland employers, e-bike dealers)

The actual SpokeToWork app will be built by forking the [ScriptHammer.com](https://scripthammer.com) template.

## Quick Links

- [Business Development](https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/SpokeToWork---Business-Development) - Pitch materials, funding strategy

## Timeline

**Beta Launch: End of January 2026**
- 5+ worker beta testers
