## Outreach Email Template

**Subject:** Partnership inquiry — workforce e-bike referrals

---

Hi,

I'm a Cleveland developer building a job platform for workers who don't have reliable car access. We match workers to jobs within biking distance.

Here's where you come in: when a worker finds a job just outside their walking range, they need an e-bike. I'd like to refer those workers to local dealers like you.

I'm exploring referral partnerships — a fee per sale in exchange for qualified leads from workers who genuinely need e-bikes for commuting.

Would you have 15 minutes to chat about whether this could work for your shop?

- [ ] Does Chatt eBikes offer payment plans?
- [ ] Affirm/Klarna integration at any shops?
- [ ] Credit union partnerships for bike loans?
